## map

This folder contains the files used to produce the map for the symptoms study (in dynamic as a cron job).

**gitignore** - a gitignore file for this part of the reporsitory.

**map_ver1.py** - produces the map.

**requirements.txt** - the requirements file used to recreate the environment needed to run the python script.

**sverige-lan-counties-of-sweden.geojson** - a geojson file showing the counties of Sweden. We now use the other geojson because this one is larger, but it could be useful in some cases as it has more detail in some respects. 

**sweden-counties.geojson** - a geojson file showing the counties of Sweden. This map is much smaller, but shows large water bodies well and provides sufficient data for our purposes.
