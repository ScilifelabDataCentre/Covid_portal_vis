WORDCLOUD

The wordcloud folder contains python script that can be used to generate a 'live' word cloud from the Covid-19 publications data. It also includes the font to be used as standard for the portal, a square shape that can be used as the 'mask' for the wordcloud (mask defines the shape) and a folder of example wordclouds. 

COUNT PUBLICATIONS

This folder contains the code used to produce 'live' counts of the cumulative number of publications in the COVID-19 publications database and the total number of publications added in each month. These are included as a line and bar plot on the same graph, respectively.
